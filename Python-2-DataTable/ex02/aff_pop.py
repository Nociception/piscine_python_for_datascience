Exercice 02: compare my country
Turn-in directory : ex02/
Files to turn in : load_csv.py, aff_pop.py
Allowed functions : matplotlib, seaborn or any lib for Data Visualization
Create a program that calls the load function from the first exercise, loads the file
population_total.csv, and displays the country information of your campus versus other
country of your choice. Your graph must have a title, a legend for each axis and a
legend for each graph.
You must display the years from 1800 to 2050.
For example, for the 42 campuses in France we will have this result
