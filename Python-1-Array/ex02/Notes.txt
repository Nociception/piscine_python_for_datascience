## assert path.lower().endswith(VALID_FORMATS)
Interesting to note that, as with isinstance, endswith works also
with an iterable of strings.

##with Image.open(path) as img:
    img = img.convert("RGB")
    pixels = np.array(img)
    print(f"The shape of image is: {pixels.shape}")
So It's possible to give the numpy array() function
a PIL.Image.Image object, in order to get the pixels' values.
Good to know.
